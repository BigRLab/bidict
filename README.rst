Participation
-------------

The bidict codebase is tiny (~400 sloc),
concise, mature, well-factored, and
`well-tested <https://github.com/jab/bidict/tree/master/tests>`_,
so it lends itself to quick ramp-up.
Yet for its small size,
it's yielded a surprising amount of fun, rewarding programming:
plugging into the collections ecosystem, careful API design,
covering various subtle edge cases,
writing `hypothesis <http://hypothesis.readthedocs.io>`_-powered
property-based tests, benchmarking, and exploring some cute
(but ultimately `rejected <https://github.com/jab/bidict/issues/19>`_)
Python syntax hacks, to name a few examples.
